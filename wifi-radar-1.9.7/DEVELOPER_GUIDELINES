o   Try to mimick the style of the code that you are working in.

o   Include a usage statement with every function/subroutine, no matter how
    simple and self-explanatory that function is.  Example:

        #
        # Description:
        #   Chooses most appropriate from the available partition tools.
        #
        # Usage:
        #   my $partition_tool = which_partition_tool();
        #
        sub which_partition_tool {
            [... code here ...]
        }

o   When you close a bug or feature request, add an appropriate line to the 
    CHANGE.LOG that includes the bug or feature number and who you are.

o   Always give people credit in the AUTHORS file.

o   Have fun!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SVN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o   The current development branch is always tagged "trunk".  It is
    intended for feature additions and funky stuff.  Unless you're just
    fixing a bug, or updating the stable documentation, this is what you
    want.

o   The stable branch is only to be used for fixing bugs.

o   Only Brian Finley will modify SVN tags for branching or for numeric-only
    releases, such as 1.2.3.  Anyone with SVN access is welcome to make their 
    own tags or branches, as is appropriate, but must include their initials
    or similar in the tag or branch name.

o   Reference Material

    o   http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Subversion
    o   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/

o   Checkout Steps for Developers
    (You should be able to just copy and paste commands 2-5)

    MY_USERNAME=finley

    o  Development trunk:

	svn checkout svn+ssh://$MY_USERNAME@svn.systemimager.org/var/lib/svn/wifi-radar/trunk wifi-radar.trunk/


    o  A particular revision of the development trunk:

	REVISION=3256
	svn checkout -r $REVISION svn+ssh://$MY_USERNAME@svn.systemimager.org/var/lib/svn/wifi-radar/trunk wifi-radar.$REVISION/


    o  A particular branch:

	BRANCH=3.4.x
	svn checkout svn+ssh://$MY_USERNAME@svn.systemimager.org/var/lib/svn/wifi-radar/branches/$BRANCH wifi-radar.$BRANCH/



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versioning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o   wifi-radar uses kernel style versioning (X.Y.Z):

    X = major architectural change
    Y = feature release
        o   An odd number indicates a development release (leading up
            to an even numbered stable release).
        o   An even number indicates a stable release.
    Z = bug fix release
        o   (no new features)

o   Development releases may be made available unofficially.
