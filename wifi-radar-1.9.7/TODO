- Center 'connected to X' text below network listing
- Integration of WPA TKIP (wpa_supplicant)? (PARTIALLY done in
  0.3.8-6mdk) 
- Set LC_MESSAGES=C in environment when wifi-radar is started, rather
  than prefixing commands with this variable.
- auto-detect wireless interfaces if no interface specified, or if
  specified interface is not wifi capable, and offer to set it: iwconfig
  2>&1 | grep ESSID | awk '{print $1}'
- have drop-down box for selecting from available wifi devices, and
  remember last one selected (write to conf)
- "Cancel" button on the "Acquiring..." dialog box.
- Rename the "Edit" button to "Configure".
- Grey out buttons that are not relevant.  Ie.: When an unconfigured
  access point is selected, grey out all buttons except for: "New" and
  "Configure".
- Add a check box to automatically close the GUI on successful IP
  acquisition.  Wait X seconds before closing.
- Make wifi-radar run as a daemon that always checks the connection
  status then Auto connects when possible.
- Add more ifconfig and iwconfig status info.
- Translate.
- Add a preferences dialog so there won't be a need to edit
  wifi-radar.conf by hand.
- Floating help thingy to say drag and drop profiles to set ordered
  preference.
- Attempt to connect to unconfigured APs, if no configured APs exist, in
  daemon mode.
