          the shell's echo command.

2005-04-12 Nicolas Brouard <nicolas.brouard@mandrake.org>
	* Release 1.9.3-3mdk
		- Partial implementation of wpa_supplicant by intergrating use_wpa = yes and
		wpa_driver= = ipw or whatever available.
		wifi-radar launnhes wpa_supplicant as a daemon after reading 
		/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf . But this latter file can't be updated
		or even set by wifi-radar yet. wpa_supplicant must be patched with the -p option
		in order to set the /var/run/wpa_supplicant.pid file.
